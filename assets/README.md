## [gemeinden.csv](gemeinden.csv)

This file provides a list of municipaly/district mappings. It is used to map municipaly names found in obituary notes and map them to district names. To avoid mismatches with arbitrary strings for district names this mapping is always used regardless of whether districts are mentioned in the notes. The data is taken from [gemeinden.at/tirol](http://www.gemeinden.at/tirol).

## [orte.scv](orte.csv)

This file provides 800+ mappings from arbitrary strings to distinct municipaly names.

These were identified using a manual process of mostly doing a google search of `<string> gemeinde tirol` to find related information.
